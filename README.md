# Dictionaries-in-python

dictionary is defined as: d = {} or d = dict()
the "d" here is dictionary and the curley brackets {} contains key values. 
the keys in dictionary are basically srtings or numbers.
the following dictionary is empty because there is no key value.

d ={} # this is an empty dictionary

# Dictionary
Here "yash" is a key and its value is 10

d["yash"] = 10

# value can be a number, string, list or even another dictionary
# note: Dictioanry doesn't care about the order reperesenting output 

# you can also change the value of any key by following method:
d["yash2"] = 22
print(d["yash2"])
# so here the value of key "yash2" is changed from 30 to 22.
